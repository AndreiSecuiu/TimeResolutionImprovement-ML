# TimeResolutionImprovement-ML
This project has the objective of improving the time resolution of a calorimeter by using machine learning. I need to predict the impact time based on the voltage curves that a neutron leaves inside the detector.

The difficulty comes from the noisy nature around the root, where the signal to noise ratio is bad.

**Note**: Add the rest of the information from my other laptop. Include:
- the corrected* presentation
- meeting notes from my various An IV - Xx files
- the meeting notes from the cloud
- comments in my notebook
- conclusions from my chat with Ramon
